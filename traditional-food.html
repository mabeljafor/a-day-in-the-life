    <h2> Traditional Food </h2>
    <p3> You told you friend about diffeent types of Traditional food. For example, you described to your friend about Hot Pot, Dim Sum, Moon Cakes, Meat Balls, 
    Ma Po Tofu, and Sticky Tofu. After you describe it, your friend all of the sudden asks you 
    "So, do your family eat um.. animals?" 
    Then you said " Yes, we do eat animals like roasted ducks and frogs." 
    However, you didnt want an answer like that. It was more like "Do you eat do domestic animals like dogs or cats?"
